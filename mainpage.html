      <h2>I'm bad at naming things soo Love you</h2>
      <p>Well, you're probably looking at me as you read this, or I got to embarrass I said you’ll read it at home, but I hope I didn’t take the cowards way out but anyways</p>
      <p>..</p>
      <p>Honestly, I don’t know what I want to put here I spent countless nights thinking and throughout it all I was left with nothing in my mind words, a quiz, a small game (would have taken forever to make) or just a display of my love. I wanted it all to make it the best I could though my mind kept racing through ideas my heart kept saying nothing in this world would be enough to show u how much I love you. 
 
        maybe I made it to store our memories, love and happiness but to me it's something I never done before cause you’re a new person in my life the person who has my heart and the one, I wish to be with through day and night all I can think of is you. 
         
        Never before have I found myself in loss of words over someone, which lead me to believe maybe I didn’t have it in me to love but thanks to you for proving me wrong with all that I love you</p>
        <p>..</p>
        <p>(hope I gave you a kiss as soon as you finished this if I didn’t slap me for me please)</p>

      <h2>whats makes you special</h2>
      <p>1: your smile, a world takes flight,
        A beacon of pure and radiant light.
        It speaks of joy, a heart sincere,
        Drawing me close, pulling me near.
        
        Each curve and gleam, a work of art,
        A masterpiece to warm the coldest heart.
        With every grin, my worries cease,
        In your smile, I find my inner peace.
        
        So wear that smile, forever true,
        For it's the magic that leads me to you.
        In your laughter, my heart finds its home,
        With your smile, I'll never feel alone.</p>
        <P>..</P>

      <p>2: In your brown eyes, behind glasses they hide,
        A world of wonder, a deep, inner stride.
        Like warm cocoa in the morning sun's grace,
        They sparkle and twinkle, a comforting place.
        
        Through those lenses, a unique view of life,
        With wisdom and charm, she conquers each strife.
        Her gaze, both intelligent and wise,
        In your brown eyes, beauty truly lies.
        
        With every glance, my heart takes its cue,
        Through your glasses, your spirit shines true.
        They frame your soul, a sweet, sweet surprise,
        I'm trapped forever by the beauty that lies in your eyes</p>
        <P>..</P>

      <p>3: your cuteness, like a ray of sun,
        You light up my world, my only one.
        With each adorable smile you share,
        You melt my heart, showing how much you care.
        
        Your sweet nature, a gentle embrace,
        Fills my life with warmth and grace.
        In every word and every touch,
        I'm captivated by you, oh, how I'm smitten so much.
        
        Your laughter, like a melody, it sings,
        Bringing joy and love on graceful wings.
        In your presence, everything feels right,
        You're my sunshine, my day and night.
        
        So, my love, with you, I'll always stay,
        In your cuteness and sweetness, come what may.
        You're the love I'll forever treasure,
        for my heart as gavin itself to you</p>
        <P>..</P>

      <p>4: your shyness, my love, I find such grace,
        A gentle charm that lights up your face.
        When you're quiet, there's a special allure,
        In your shy moments, my heart feels so sure.
        
        Around me, you're comfortable, my dear,
        Your laughter, your smile, like music I hear.
        In your eyes, I see a trust so profound,
        In your presence, my love, happiness is found.
        
        Your shyness, to me, is a treasure so rare,
        A beautiful bloom, beyond compare.
        With you, I'm cherished, my heart feels so free,
        In your shy love, you're the one I long to see.
        
        So, in your gentle shyness, my heart's found its place,
        In your comfort, my love, I've found my embrace.
        You're the one who's captured my heart, you see,
        In your shy love, forever, you have me.</p>
